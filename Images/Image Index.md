IMG_0224.jpg: Glamor shot. I couldn't resist. Hat and lights (finished) are visible sitting on my Saitek X52 stick next to my switch panel (also built myself, more information [on my Instructables page](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Flight-Sim-Switch-Panel/)

IMG_0242.jpg: Close-up of top LED, showing how it's attached to the frame. Other LEDs use the same mounting technique.  
IMG_0244.jpg: Close-up of nuts holding the LED frame to the brim of the hat.  
IMG_0246.jpg: Underside of hat brim. Visible screws are the ones holding the LED frame on. Holes on left and right (hard to see) are for the extra brim support (not used here)
