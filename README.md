# headtracker
.stl files for a headtracker, designed to be 3d printed and attached to a baseball cap with M3 hardware

Circuit design is left to you (there are many ways to power three LEDs and different methods will be more or less suited to different situations). I reccomend LEDs with wide viewing angles. Can be used with IR LEDs and an IR camera (in theory).

## software
I highly reccomend opentrack as software (https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack). It's free and open-source, user-friendly, capable, and compatible with everything I've tried so far.
